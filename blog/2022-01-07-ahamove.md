## Strategic partnership with ahamove
<img src="/img/ahamove.png"/>

Last week we have an official MoU signing ceremony with a strategic partner [AhaMove](https://ahamove.com/). AhaMove is one of the leading companies in Vietnam in logistics. They provide Uber-like service for goods delivery with a network of 100K shippers and 300K merchants in 10 major cities in Vietnam. 

While being a delivery service company, AhaMove consists a team full of technical-savies. [Ngon Pham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngonpham/), AhaMove CEO, is a software engineer veteran. He used to work for Google and a bunch of other tech startups before becoming CEO of AhaMove. Some members of both teams have long-time friendship in the tech community in Vietnam. It's so exciting that we finally become business partners and have the chance to build something together. 

What in it for a company like AhaMove to work with Aura Network ? They actually are exploring use cases for the Metaverse:

>With the network of 100K drivers and 300K merchants in Vietnam, AhaMove is transitioning to become a "Metaverse Enabler". AhaMove can help Metaverse companies to connect to the offline merchant network as well as find more earning opportunities for drivers, freelancers in the metaverse world -- Ngon said
