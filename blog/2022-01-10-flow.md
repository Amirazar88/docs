Last week one of our advisors asked what are differences between Aura Network and the popular [Flow](https://www.onflow.org/) platform. While we haven't got any chance to actually trying to build applications on Flow, there are several fundamental differences in term of vision and technical choices. This article provides some insight from our experiences on those matters.

## Flow platform

Flow is a layer-1 blockchain platform focusing on games, apps and digital assets. It is created by [Dapper](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), the team behind the ever popular [Crypto Kitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) DAPP on Ethereum. Despite the success of the DAPP, the team found several problems with the Ethereum ecosystem, mainly about software performance and transaction cost. 

That's why they created Flow, hoping to change the world of entertainment and culture like how Bitcoin and Ethereum did to the world of finance. Flow has several interesting architecture choices.

## Network Architecture
Flow blockchain provides a multi-node architecture where blockchain nodes are divided into different roles:

- Collection Nodes: collect transactions and serve DAPP
- Execution Nodes: ex
- Verification Nodes: Make 
- Consensus Nodes: Arrange order of transaction and create blocks
