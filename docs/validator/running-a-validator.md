# Running a Validator

This is a detailed documentation for setting up a **Validator** on Aura network.

:::caution Remarks:
The following is the minimal setup to join Aura network.

You should research validator security.
:::

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.17+
- GCC/G++ compiler

### Supported OS

We officially support Linux only. Other platforms may work, but there is no guarantee. We will extend our support to other platforms after we have stabilized our current architecture.

### Commonly used ports

`aurad` uses the following TCP ports. Toggle their settings to fit your environment.

- *26656*: The default port for the P2P protocol. This port is used to communicate with other nodes and must be open to join a network. However, it does not have to be open to the public. For validator nodes, we recommend configuring `persistent_peers` and closing this port to the public.

Additional ports:

- *1317*: The default port for the Lite Client Daemon (LCD), which can be executed by `aurad rest-server`. The LCD provides an HTTP RESTful API layer to allow applications and services to interact with your `aurad instance` through RPC. You donâ€™t need to open this port unless you have use for it.

- *26657*: The default port for the `Tendermint RPC protocol`. Because this port is used for querying and sending transactions, it must be open for serving queries from `aurad`.

## Networks information

Genesis files and configurations are located in [Github repository](https://github.com/aura-nw/testnets)

## Setup a full-node

This guide completes the following actions:
- Compile `aurad`
- Give your node a moniker and configure it
- Configure genesis state 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aura-nw/aura
$ cd aura
$ make
$ aurad init <moniker> 
$ wget <genesis-json-link>
$ mv genesis.json ~/.aura/config/genesis.json
```

Start your full-node:
```bash
$ aurad start --p2p.seeds <seed-id>@<seed-ip>:<seed-p2p-port> --minimum-gas-prices <gas-price>
```
:::note For optimized node performance, set `minimum-gas-prices` to enable the anti-spam mechanism and reject incoming transactions with less than the minimum gas prices.
:::

After starting your full-node, wait until it completely sync transactions to your local to start create your validator.

###  Optional Configuration: State Sync
State sync rapidly bootstraps a new node by discovering, fetching, and restoring a state machine snapshot from peers instead of fetching and replaying historical blocks

Visit a explorer to get a recent block height and corresponding hash. The recommended snapshot period is 1000 blocks, it is advised to choose something close to current height - 1000. Set these parameters in the code snippet below <BLOCK_HEIGHT>, <BLOCK_HASH>, <RPC_SERVER_1> and <RPC_SERVER_2>

```
$ cd $HOME/.aura/config
$ sed -i 's/enable = false/enable = true/' config.toml
$ sed -i 's/trust_height = 0/trust_height = <BLOCK_HEIGHT>/' config.toml
$ sed -i 's/trust_hash = ""/trust_hash = "<BLOCK_HASH>"/' config.toml
$ sed -i 's/rpc_servers = ""/rpc_servers = "<RPC_SERVER_1>,<RPC_SERVER_2>"/' config.toml
```

## Create your validator
You need to add your `wallet key` using `mnemonic` or create a new key and tranfer `uaura` to its address
```bash
 aurad keys add <key_name> 
```

Your `auravalconspub` can be used to create a new validator by staking tokens. You can find your validator pubkey by running:
```
$ aurad tendermint show-validator
```
To create your validator, just use the following command:
```bash
$ aurad tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=<staking-amount> \
  --pubkey=$(aurad tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="choose a moniker"  \
  --chain-id=<chain-id> \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1000000" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-prices=<choose gas price> \
  --from=<key_name>
```

You can confirm that you are in the validator set by using a third party explorer or `aurad cli`
```bash
aurad query staking validators
aurad query tendermint-validator-set
```
