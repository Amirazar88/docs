# Introduction
Aura Network is a layer-1, NFT-centric blockchain that focuses on expanding the use of NFTs across various industries. Our vision is to create a one-stop destination for minting, evaluating, querying, and transacting NFTs, to become a pioneer NFT infrastructure for the future.

Aura Network provides 3 main features:

- A universal framework for all stakeholders to create a one stop destination for developing new NFT use cases.
- A multi-chain platform that can support both crypto communities and traditional businesses.
- An infrastructure layer for building and integrating your applications to the metaverse

Aura Network is built using [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk), the world's most used framework for building blockchains.
