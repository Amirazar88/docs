#Introduction

The Aura Safe is a web application that allow multiple people – co-owners – together manage a “Safe” – an address that digital assets of the blockchain network can be contained and transferred, just like a personal wallet. However, moving asset out of the safe requires a consensus between co-owners. 

A fixed consensus policy of “M out of N” must be defined upon safe creation, in which M is the number of required owner signatures and N is the total number of owners. After that, all transactions that move assets out of the Safe must have at least M signatures before they can be executed.
